Hi,

Made this for fun and to confirm how truly horrible ViaRail delays can be. If you want to see the data/results, just check out my Looker Studio dashboard here

The project is broken down into a few steps listed here.

0. Used Terraform to build the GCP infastructure, including buckets for the datalake, and staging/prod datasets in BigQuery.
1. I used Kestra, which is a data orchestration tool, to run a shell script every 5 minutes that grabs the JSON file from ViaRail's "API" and puts them into my datalake in Google Cloud Storage. 
  It also does some very minimal preprocessing like adding a collected_at feature.
    - ViaRail posts live, mostly complete, data every few minutes including all current train routes, their stops, and timing information.
2. Even though Spark might seem overkill for this amount of data I'm currently working with (a few million rows), I believe it's justifiable since the data grows very, very quickly.
    - Spark processes the raw JSONS and builds them into a Star Schema data warehouse with the proper fact and dim tables detailed below.
    - It's then loaded into the staging dataset in BigQuery.
    - A mixture of the ORM and pure SQL were used to build this. This is because I like writing window functions, and a few other things, in pure SQL.
3. Using incremental models in DBT, the fact and dim tables are created/updated in the "prod" dataset.
4. Data marts are created for stop-by-stop performance, and end-to-end train delay analysis.

    time_fact: Delay time calculations
  Dim Tables
    train_dim: Train identifiers and metadata
    station_dim: Station names and codes
    route_stop_dim: Sequence of stops per route
    train_time_dim: Scheduled and actual times
